## How to add a new section:
>The images are stored in docs that is public, from the site sapogin
pdf files are stored in my droplet with api: 146.190.233.254

Add a new section to the site in the file: `src\stores\sections.ts`. Then create a .vue file in `src\pages`, the file name should be the same as the section's path.
class 'image'  makes images fit well.

!DANGER! ->  Do not sync with GitHub.

!! The `docs` files you must save in my IP adress 
audio looks in folder called audio, it should be in sapogin/html

> Vitesse will not build if you try to import, point, use for a file that does not exist

## Server configuration do expose audio

``` nginx
location ~ \.(mp3|mp4) {
    root /var/www/sapogin.com/html;
    sendfile   on;
    tcp_nopush on;
}
```

Note: It seams that when you move the mp3 files to server, it limits the size of mp3. Move them one by one
